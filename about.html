                    On November 12, 1966, five men who were digging a grave at a cemetery near Clendenin, West Virginia, claimed to have seen a man-like figure fly low from the trees over their heads. This is often identified as the first known sighting of what became known as the Mothman.

                    Shortly thereafter, on November 15, 1966, two young couples from Point Pleasant, Roger and Linda Scarberry and Steve and Mary Mallette, told police they saw a large grey creature whose eyes "glowed red" when the car's headlights picked it up. They described it as a "large flying man with ten-foot wings", following their car while they were driving in an area outside of town known as "the TNT area", the site of a former World War II munitions plant.

                    The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Let's make a happy little mountain now. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.

This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Let's do it again then, what the heck.
