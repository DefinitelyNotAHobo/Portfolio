        <p>Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. In your world you have total and absolute power. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.
        </p>
        <p>This piece of canvas is your world. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Isn't that fantastic? We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.

        <p>All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. All kinds of happy little splashes. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Anything you want to do you can do here.
