## Mothman's Portfolio

Description  
-------------------------  
This repo was restructured as a landing page for the Mothman.  
Contains a home and about page, a blog, a form to submit questions and a space for a F.A.Q.

Optional features  
-------------------------  
Use of Flexbox  
Collapsing menu  
Javascript powered slideshow
Media Query breakdown from one to multiple columns (mainly applies to Nav bar on each page and the content on the About page)  
Contact form (tests for proper formatting of email and has required fields but is for demonstration and doesn't actually submit anywhere due to security concerns)  

Instructions for Running  
--------------------------  
This project functions as a simple webpage and no special care needs to be taken in the navigation outside of remembering that the contact form is not configured to send anywhere. (an alert pops up to remind anyone who clicks "Send Message")
